Hi, I am a professional Foswiki consultant living in Hamburg, Germany. I help people to improve knowledge sharing in organizations, fostering skills development and improving overall communication using web technologies. Foswiki is particularly well suited as a platform to build the tools needed. It is the key technology towards better understanding and transparency in everyday's work. There is no other tool that fits such a broad range of use cases starting from personal information management up to multilingual distributed enterprise platforms serving the needs of thousands of knowledge workers simultaneously.
